![Fallout 4 Pip Boy Addon](../fallout-4-pip-boy.png)

Like the rest of the world, I've been playing Fallout 4. The game itself is very good, it's improved pretty much everything from 3, which I admittedly didn't like that much.

Where Fallout 3 felt like an RPG with guns, 4 actually feels like a shooter with RPG and adventure elements. Well, in all but one respect, the settlement builder minigame they've been touting so much. While it certainly looks powerful, and I can now confirm it to be, I still have zero interest in using it. I really hope I'm not further required to do so.

Arguably my favorite addition to the new installment is the [Pip-Boy mobile app][1]. It's unreasonably fun to use and still impresses me with how seamlessly it integrates with the game. While primarily intended for use with the pretty neat [Pip-Boy Edition replica][2], you can use any relatively new android or iOS device connected to the same network as your PC or console playing the game. I'm using my Nexus 7 and it's basically perfect. I even ordered a [cheap folding case][3] to prop it up a bit on my desk while I play.

It adds a really cool and immersive element to the game, precisely because of how slightly inconvenient it is to use. Unlike pressing tab and bringing up the in-game Pip-Boy, using the tablet doesn't pause the game, so you actually need to run and find cover to quickly fumble through the menus, just as your character is. On my 7 inch screen, some of the elements are slightly hard to press, though to be fair the same elements are hard to click on using the in-game one as well. I can't imagine it would be terribly usable with a phone, although I haven't tried it. A larger 10-inch tablet would probably be ideal, but it's more than usable with the 7. From this point forward I am going to try to rely solely on the app and the favorite menu to get me through the game.
